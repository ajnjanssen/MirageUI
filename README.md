```

### Running the Project

To run the project locally, use the following commands:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Running the Project with Docker

To run the project using Docker, follow these steps:

1. **Create a Dockerfile**:

Create a 

Dockerfile

 in the root of your project with the following content:

```Dockerfile
FROM node:18

WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN yarn install
COPY . .
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["yarn", "dev"]
```

2. **Create a 

docker-compose.yml

 file**:

Create a 

docker-compose.yml

 file in the root of your project with the following content:

```yaml
services:
  app:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    volumes:
      - .:/app
      - /app/node_modules
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=development
    command: yarn dev
```

3. **Build and run the Docker container**:

Use the following commands to build and run the Docker container:

```bash
docker-compose down
docker-compose up --build
```

This will start the application in development mode with hot reloading enabled. Any changes you make to the files in your local project directory will be reflected inside the Docker container.

4. **Access the application**:

Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to access the application.

### Usage

      headerColor="primary"
      subText="This is the library page"
